FormAlchemy2
============

FormAlchemy2 generates forms, validates and stores input data to your
favorite backend.

FormAlchemy2 is a rewrite of FormAlchemy. The first version of FormAlchemy was
written to generate HTML forms given an SQLAlchemy mapped object. But later
FormAlchemy also added support for other backends, like ZopeDB, CouchDB,
etc... This was nice, but the design of FormAlchemy was still too coupled to
SQLAlchemy and made it unpleasant to extend to other backends.

FormAlchemy2 is written to be extensible from the ground up by plugging any
backend system you can think of. FormAlchemy2's core is meant to be reduced at
the strict minimum and provide a developer-friendly API for manipulating forms
using any backend you like.
